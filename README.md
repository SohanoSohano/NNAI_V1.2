## üåü Future Enhancements

While NeuroForge provides a robust foundation, several potential enhancements could further increase its capabilities and impact, aligning with future trends in AI and software development:

### Expanded Evolutionary Capabilities
- **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: Extend the platform beyond weight optimization to allow users to evolve the structure of the neural network itself, automating a complex aspect of model design.
- **Improve GA Engine with Advanced Evolutionary Algorithms**: Incorporate more sophisticated techniques like hybrid algorithms (e.g., memetic algorithms combining GA with local search) or adaptive GAs that self-tune parameters during runtime.
- **Scalability & Parallelism**: Implement options for distributed/parallel execution of GA tasks across multiple workers or nodes to handle larger populations or more complex models efficiently.

### Deeper AI Integration & Analysis
- **Proactive AI Assistance**: Leverage the platform's AI to suggest optimal GA configurations based on the uploaded model type, task description, or past results, moving towards AI-assisted programming and AutoML concepts. The AI could potentially pre-analyze uploaded models for common issues.
- **Enhanced AI Advisor**: Improve the AI Advisor with conversational memory, the ability to ingest a wider range of user-provided documents, and potentially integrate multimodal capabilities.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Allow users to compare results across multiple evolution runs, potentially with AI generating comparative analysis reports highlighting key differences and performance trade-offs.

### Platform & User Experience
- **MLOps Integration**: Provide integrations with popular MLOps platforms (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases) for experiment tracking, model versioning, and logging.
- **Expanded Framework Support**: Add support for other major deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Offer more diverse and interactive visualization options for analyzing population dynamics, fitness landscapes, and model architectures.
