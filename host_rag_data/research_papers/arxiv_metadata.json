Their size and availability make them amenable to being analyzed at\na behavioral as well as a representational level, allowing investigations of\nhow these levels interact. We evaluate 32 publicly available language models\nfor their representational and behavioral alignment with human similarity\njudgments on a word triplet task. This provides a novel evaluation setting to\nprobe semantic associations in language beyond common pairwise comparisons. We\nfind that (1) even the representations of small language models can achieve\nhuman-level alignment, (2) instruction-tuned model variants can exhibit\nsubstantially increased agreement, (3) the pattern of alignment across layers\nis highly model dependent, and (4) alignment based on models' behavioral\nresponses is highly dependent on model size, matching their representational\nalignment only for the largest evaluated models.",

Motivated by this observation, we develop a novel class of\ntest-time optimization methods to re-weight or \"re-mixing\" the experts in\ndifferent layers jointly for each test sample. Since the test sample's ground\ntruth is unknown, we propose to optimize a surrogate objective defined by the\nsample's \"successful neighbors\" from a reference set of samples. We introduce\nthree surrogates and algorithms based on mode-finding, kernel regression, and\nthe average loss of similar reference samples/tasks. To reduce the cost of\noptimizing whole pathways, we apply our algorithms merely to the core experts'\nmixing weights in critical layers, which enjoy similar performance but save\nsignificant computation. This leads to \"Critical-Layer, Core-Expert,\nCollaborative Pathway Optimization (C3PO)\". We apply C3PO to two recent MoE\nLLMs and examine it on six widely-used benchmarks. It consistently improves the\nbase model by 7-15% in accuracy and outperforms widely used test-time learning\nbaselines, e.g., in-context learning and prompt/prefix tuning, by a large\nmargin.

Previous\nMLLM-based methods commonly struggle with the dilemma between \"Ref\" and \"VOS\":\nthey either specialize in understanding a few key frames (global reasoning) or\ntracking objects on continuous frames (local reasoning), and rely on external\nVOS or frame selectors to mitigate the other end of the challenge. However, our\nframework GLUS shows that global and local consistency can be unified into a\nsingle video segmentation MLLM: a set of sparse \"context frames\" provides\nglobal information, while a stream of continuous \"query frames\" conducts local\nobject tracking. This is further supported by jointly training the MLLM with a\npre-trained VOS memory bank to simultaneously digest short-range and long-range\ntemporal information. To improve the information efficiency within the limited\ncontext window of MLLMs, we introduce object contrastive learning to\ndistinguish hard false-positive objects and a self-refined framework to\nidentify crucial frames and perform propagation. By collectively integrating\nthese insights, our GLUS delivers a simple yet effective baseline, achieving\nnew state-of-the-art for MLLMs on the MeViS and Ref-Youtube-VOS benchmark.

Unlike existing methods that rely on language-based task\ninstruction, leading to task ambiguity and weak generalization, we integrate\nvisual in-context learning, allowing models to identify tasks from visual\ndemonstrations. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of visual task distributions\nhampers the learning of transferable knowledge across tasks. To this end, we\nintroduce Graph200K, a graph-structured dataset that establishes various\ninterrelated tasks, enhancing task density and transferable knowledge.\nFurthermore, we uncover that our unified image generation formulation shared a\nconsistent objective with image infilling, enabling us to leverage the strong\ngenerative priors of pre-trained infilling models without modifying the\narchitectures.",

Our method leverages pre-calibrated color\ncorrection matrices (CCMs) available on ISPs that map the camera's raw color\nspace to a standard space (e.g., CIE XYZ). Our method uses these CCMs to\ntransform predefined illumination colors (i.e., along the Planckian locus) into\nthe test camera's raw space. The mapped illuminants are encoded into a compact\ncamera fingerprint embedding (CFE) that enables the network to adapt to unseen\ncameras. To prevent overfitting due to limited cameras and CCMs during\ntraining, we introduce a data augmentation technique that interpolates between\ncameras and their CCMs. Experimental results across multiple datasets and\nbackbones show that our method achieves state-of-the-art cross-camera color\nconstancy while remaining lightweight and relying only on data readily\navailable in camera ISPs.",

In tasks\nprone to arithmetic mistakes, such as balancing equations, DC enabled GPT-4o\nand Claude to reach near-perfect accuracy by recalling previously validated\ncode, whereas their baselines stagnated around 50%. Beyond arithmetic\nchallenges, DC yields notable accuracy gains on knowledge-demanding tasks.\nClaude achieved a 9% improvement in GPQA-Diamond and an 8% boost on MMLU-Pro\nproblems. Crucially, DC's memory is self-curated, focusing on concise,\ntransferable snippets rather than entire transcript. Unlike finetuning or\nstatic retrieval methods, DC adapts LMs' problem-solving skills on the fly,\nwithout modifying their underlying parameters. Overall, our findings present DC\nas a promising approach for augmenting LMs with persistent memory, bridging the\ndivide between isolated inference events and the cumulative, experience-driven\nlearning characteristic of human cognition.",

Current approaches\ninvolve integrating separately pre-trained components, such as connecting\nvision encoders to LLMs and continuing multimodal training. While such\napproaches exhibit remarkable sample efficiency, it remains an open question\nwhether such late-fusion architectures are inherently superior. In this work,\nwe revisit the architectural design of native multimodal models (NMMs)--those\ntrained from the ground up on all modalities--and conduct an extensive scaling\nlaws study, spanning 457 trained models with different architectures and\ntraining mixtures. Our investigation reveals no inherent advantage to\nlate-fusion architectures over early-fusion ones, which do not rely on image\nencoders. On the contrary, early-fusion exhibits stronger performance at lower\nparameter counts, is more efficient to train, and is easier to deploy.\nMotivated by the strong performance of the early-fusion architectures, we show\nthat incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoEs) allows for models that learn\nmodality-specific weights, significantly enhancing performance.",

We\npresent InteracttAvatar, the first model to faithfully capture the\nphotorealistic appearance of dynamic hand and non-rigid hand-face interactions.\nOur novel Dynamic Gaussian Hand model, combining template model and 3D Gaussian\nSplatting as well as a dynamic refinement module, captures pose-dependent\nchange, e.g. the fine wrinkles and complex shadows that occur during\narticulation. Importantly, our hand-face interaction module models the subtle\ngeometry and appearance dynamics that underlie common gestures.

To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel framework, GenEAva, for generating high-quality cartoon avatars with\nfine-grained facial expressions.

Leveraging this framework, we introduce the first expressive\ncartoon avatar dataset, GenEAva 1.0, specifically designed to capture 135\nfine-grained facial expressions, featuring 13,230 expressive cartoon avatars\nwith a balanced distribution across genders, racial groups, and age ranges. We\ndemonstrate that our fine-tuned model generates more expressive faces than the\nstate-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model SDXL. We also verify that the\ncartoon avatars generated by our framework do not include memorized identities\nfrom fine-tuning data.

Our key insight is that the difficulty of\ntraining data during reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is critical. Appropriately\nchallenging samples can substantially boost reasoning capabilities even when\nthe dataset is small. Despite being intuitive, the main challenge remains in\naccurately quantifying sample difficulty to enable effective data filtering. To\nthis end, we propose a novel way of repurposing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\nto achieve that. Starting from our curated 70k open-source training samples, we\nintroduce an MCTS-based selection method that quantifies sample difficulty\nbased on the number of iterations required by the VLMs to solve each problem.\nThis explicit step-by-step reasoning in MCTS enforces the model to think longer\nand better identifies samples that are genuinely challenging. We filter and\nretain 11k samples to perform RFT on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, resulting in our\nfinal model, ThinkLite-VL. Evaluation results on eight benchmarks show that\nThinkLite-VL improves the average performance of Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by 7%,\nusing only 11k training samples with no knowledge distillation.

Our\nground-state calculations reveal a rich array of interaction- and\nfilling-dependent phases, including the FCI, Chern insulator, and generalized\nWigner crystal, etc., explaining recent experimental observations. Moreover, we\nreveal quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at\nfractional moir\\'e unit cell fillings, which opens new avenues for experimental\nexploration in tMoTe$_2$. In the FCI phase, dynamical simulations reveal a\nsingle-particle continuum with a finite charge gap, indicating the presence of\nfractional charge excitations. Moreover, our finite-temperature calculations\ndetermine the characteristic temperatures for charge activation and\nferromagnetic (FM) transitions, consistent with experiments. We find that the\ncharge gap is significantly larger than the energy scales of both thermal\nactivation and FM transitions, explaining recent experimental observations.\nOverall, by integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical\ntensor-network calculations on the real-space model, we establish a theoretical\nframework for understanding and exploring correlated topological phases in\ntMoTe$_2$ and related systems.",

We derive the market-based\nportfolio variance and its decomposition by its securities, which accounts for\nthe impact of random trade volumes and is a polynomial of the 4th degree in the\nvariables of the relative amounts invested into the securities. To do that, we\ntransform the time series of market trades with the securities of the portfolio\nand obtain the time series of trades with the portfolio as a single market\nsecurity. The time series of market trades determine the market-based means and\nvariances of prices and returns of the portfolio in the same form as the means\nand variances of any market security. The decomposition of the market-based\nvariance of returns of the portfolio by its securities follows from the\nstructure of the time series of market trades of the portfolio as a single\nsecurity. The market-based decompositions of the portfolio's variances of\nprices and returns could help the managers of multi-billion portfolios and the\ndevelopers of large market and macroeconomic models like BlackRock's Aladdin,\nJP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed adjust their models and forecasts to the reality of\nrandom markets.",

        "summary": "Many low-dose CT imaging methods rely on supervised learning, which requires\na large number of paired noisy and clean images. However, obtaining paired\nimages in clinical practice is challenging. To address this issue, zero-shot\nself-supervised methods train denoising networks using only the information\nwithin a single image, such as ZS-N2N. However, these methods often employ\ndownsampling operations that degrade image resolution. Additionally, the\ntraining dataset is inherently constrained to the image itself. In this paper,\nwe propose a zero-shot low-dose CT imaging method based on sinogram flicking,\nwhich operates within a single image but generates many copies via random\nconjugate ray matching. Specifically, two conjugate X-ray pencil beams measure\nthe same path; their expected values should be identical, while their noise\nlevels vary during measurements. By randomly swapping portions of the conjugate\nX-rays in the sinogram domain, we generate a large set of sinograms with\nconsistent content but varying noise patterns. When displayed dynamically,\nthese sinograms exhibit a flickering effect due to their identical structural\ncontent but differing noise patterns-hence the term sinogram flicking. We train\nthe network on pairs of sinograms with the same content but different noise\ndistributions using a lightweight model adapted from ZS-NSN. This process is\nrepeated to obtain the final results. A simulation study demonstrates that our\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art approaches such as ZS-N2N.",

In the realm of the Effective Field\nTheory (EFT) of inflationary fluctuations, we renormalize the quadratic\nLagrangian dictating the linear dynamics of gauge-invariant perturbations.\nSince gravity is a non-renormalizable theory, this procedure is performed\nperturbatively in terms of negative powers of the EFT strong coupling scales.\nSince the interactions we consider are purely gravitational, they are\nubiquitous and independent of the details of the EFT. Our results are thus\nrelevant for a large class of approximately scale-invariant inflationary\nscenarios, be them driven by a single scalar field with canonical kinetic\nterms, or with a non-canonical structure \\textit{\\`a la} $P(X,\\phi)$, or for an\neffective single-field description at the level of fluctuations only and\nemerging from a covariant multifield theory. Using dimensional regularization,\nwe show that time-dependent Ultra-Violet (UV) divergences appearing at the loop\nlevel can be canceled at all times by an appropriate splitting of the bare\nLagrangian into renormalized operators and counterterms. Moreover, we\nexplicitly compute all finite contributions to the loops and we prove that,\ntaking into account backreaction, the final one-loop renormalized power spectra\nof both the primordial curvature perturbation and of gravitational waves are\nexactly conserved on super-horizon scales.

When only photometric variability is used to measure DWD\nintrinsic properties, there is a degeneracy between the chirp mass and binary\ntidal interaction, as orbital frequency time derivative is set by both GW\nradiation and tides. Without expensive radial velocity data from spectroscopic\nmonitoring, this degeneracy may be lifted in principle by directly measuring\nthe second time derivative of the orbital frequency through photometric\nmonitoring over an ultra-long time baseline. Alternatively, the degeneracy can\nbe removed by exploiting information in both photometric variability and the\ncoherent GW waveform. Investigating both approaches, we find that direct\nmeasurement of the second time derivative is likely infeasible for most DWDs,\nwhile the multi-messenger method will disentangle measurements of the chirp\nmass and the binary moments of inertia, for a large sample of tidally locked\nsystems.

These\nCA-HAR methods either predicted each label independently or manually imposed\nrelationships using graphs. However, both strategies often neglect an essential\naspect: activity labels have rich semantic relationships. For instance,\nwalking, jogging, and running activities share similar movement patterns but\ndiffer in pace and intensity, indicating that they are semantically related.\nConsequently, prior CA-HAR methods often struggled to accurately capture these\ninherent and nuanced relationships, particularly on datasets with noisy labels\ntypically used for CA-HAR or situations where the ideal sensor type is\nunavailable (e.g., recognizing speech without audio sensors). To address this\nlimitation, we propose SEAL, which leverage LMs to encode CA-HAR activity\nlabels to capture semantic relationships. LMs generate vector embeddings that\npreserve rich semantic information from natural language. Our SEAL approach\nencodes input-time series sensor data from smart devices and their associated\nactivity and context labels (text) as vector embeddings. During training, SEAL\naligns the sensor data representations with their corresponding\nactivity/context label embeddings in a shared embedding space. At inference\ntime, SEAL performs a similarity search, returning the CA-HAR label with the\nembedding representation closest to the input data. Although LMs have been\nwidely explored in other domains, surprisingly, their potential in CA-HAR has\nbeen underexplored, making our approach a novel contribution to the field.

Namely, we observe that the scaling relation $t_{ann} \\propto\n1/V^{2/3}_{bias}$ for the annihilation time $t_{ann}$ fits to the simulation\ndata better than a commonly assumed $t_{ann} \\propto 1/V_{bias}$. As a result,\nthe energy density of gravitational waves produced by the network of biased\ndomain walls, for a given tiny $V_{bias}$, is suppressed compared to naive\nexpectations. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is similar to that\nresulting from unbiased domain walls, but with more power in the\nclose-to-maximum ultraviolet part. In the far ultraviolet region, the spectrum\nof gravitational waves becomes nearly flat; such a plateau has been recognized\nearlier in the case of unbiased walls. In our investigation we mainly focus on\nthe symmetry breaking potential $V_{breaking} \\propto \\chi^3$, and argue that\nno significant modifications of the domain walls evolution take place if one\nincludes higher powers of $\\chi$.",

Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often\nsuboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the\nembedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising\nfast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a\nfew steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any\nperformance drop during the adaptation process. Notably, we demonstrate that\nexisting BFMs learn a set of skills containing more performant policies than\nthose identified by their inference procedure, making them well-suited for fast\nadaptation. Motivated by this observation, we propose both actor-critic and\nactor-only fast adaptation strategies that search in the low-dimensional\ntask-embedding space of the pre-trained BFM to rapidly improve the performance\nof its zero-shot policies on any downstream task. Notably, our approach\nmitigates the initial \"unlearning\" phase commonly observed when fine-tuning\npre-trained RL models. We evaluate our fast adaptation strategies on top of\nfour state-of-the-art zero-shot RL methods in multiple navigation and\nlocomotion domains.

At these baselines, Sgr A* observations will be affected by the\ndiffractive scattering effects from the interstellar medium (ISM). Therefore,\nwe study how different parameter choices for turbulence in the ISM affect\nBHEX's observational capabilities to probe strong lensing features of Sgr A*.\nBy using a simple geometric model of concentric Gaussian rings for Sgr A*'s\nphoton ring signal and observing at 320 GHz, we find that the BHEX-ALMA\nbaseline has the required sensitivity to observe Sgr A* for a broad range of\nvalues of the power-law index of density fluctuations in the ISM and the inner\nscale of turbulence. For other baselines with moderate sensitivities, a strong\nneed for observations at shorter scales of $\\approx$ 13.5 G$\\lambda$ is\nidentified. For this purpose, an orbit migration scheme is proposed. It is\nmodeled using both chemical propulsion (CP)-based Hohmann transfers and\nelectric propulsion (EP)-based orbit raising with the result that a CP-based\ntransfer can be performed in a matter of hours, but with a significantly higher\nfuel requirement as compared to EP, which however requires a transfer time of\naround 6 weeks. The consequences of these orbits for probing Sgr A*'s spacetime\nis studied by quantifying the spatial resolution, temporal resolution and the\nangular sampling of the photon ring signal in the Fourier coverage of each of\nthese orbits. We show that higher orbits isolate spacetime features while\nsacrificing both, signal lost to scattering and temporal resolution, but gain\ngreater access to the morphology of the photon ring.",

However, this improved accuracy comes at the\ncost of high inference latency due to the length of generated reasoning\nsequences and the autoregressive nature of decoding. Our key insight in\ntackling these overheads is that LRM inference, and the reasoning that it\nembeds, is highly tolerant of approximations: complex tasks are typically\nbroken down into simpler steps, each of which brings utility based on the\nsemantic insight it provides for downstream steps rather than the exact tokens\nit generates. Accordingly, we introduce SpecReason, a system that automatically\naccelerates LRM inference by using a lightweight model to (speculatively) carry\nout simpler intermediate reasoning steps and reserving the costly base model\nonly to assess (and potentially correct) the speculated outputs. Importantly,\nSpecReason's focus on exploiting the semantic flexibility of thinking tokens in\npreserving final-answer accuracy is complementary to prior speculation\ntechniques, most notably speculative decoding, which demands token-level\nequivalence at each step. Across a variety of reasoning benchmarks, SpecReason\nachieves 1.5-2.5$\\times$ speedup over vanilla LRM inference while improving\naccuracy by 1.0-9.9\\%.

The proposed integer\nhandling is carefully designed by reviewing existing integer handlings and\nfollowing the design principles of CatCMA. Even when applied to mixed-integer\nproblems, it stabilizes the marginal probability and improves the convergence\nperformance of continuous variables. Numerical experiments show that CatCMAwM\neffectively handles the three types of variables, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods and baselines that simply\nincorporate existing integer handlings into CatCMA.",

We find that in presence of a time\nderivative of the scalar field, driven by the cosmological expansion, this\nregularity generically imposes large scalar charges for black holes, even when\nassuming strictly no direct coupling of matter to the scalar field. Such\ncharges cause a significant accretion of the scalar field by the black holes,\ndriving its local time derivative to a small value. This phenomenon, together\nwith the Vainshtein screening typical of these theories, strongly suppresses\nobservable scalar effects. We show that this full class of models is consistent\nwith LIGO/Virgo detections of gravitational waves, but that the LISA mission\nshould be able to constrain the coefficient of the quintic term at the\n$10^{-30}$ level in a self-acceleration scenario, an improvement by 16 orders\nof magnitude with respect to what is imposed by the speed of gravitational\nwaves.",

However, this widespread accessibility to shared\nmulti-tenant systems also introduces potential security vulnerabilities. In\nthis work, we present for the first time a set of novel attacks, named together\nas the QubitHammer attacks, which target state-of-the-art superconducting\nquantum computers. We show that in a multi-tenant cloud-based quantum system,\nan adversary with the basic capability to deploy custom pulses, similar to any\nstandard user today, can utilize the QubitHammer attacks to significantly\ndegrade the fidelity of victim circuits located on the same quantum computer.\nUpon extensive evaluation, the QubitHammer attacks achieve a very high\nvariational distance of up to 0.938 from the expected outcome, thus\ndemonstrating their potential to degrade victim computation. Our findings\nexhibit the effectiveness of these attacks across various superconducting\nquantum computers from a leading vendor, suggesting that QubitHammer represents\na new class of security attacks.

        "summary": "We present a formula for the universal anomalous scaling of the multipole\nmoments of a generic gravitating source in classical general relativity. We\nderive this formula in two independent ways using effective field theory\nmethods. First, we use the absorption of low frequency gravitational waves by a\nblack hole to identify the total multipole scaling dimension as the\nrenormalized angular momentum of black hole perturbation theory. More\ngenerally, we show that the anomalous dimension is determined by phase shifts\nof gravitational waves elastically scattering off generic source multipole\nmoments, which reproduces the renormalized angular momentum in the particular\ncase of black holes. The effective field theory approach thus clarifies the\nrole of the renormalized angular momentum in the multipole expansion. The\nuniversality of the point-particle effective description of compact gravitating\nsystems further allows us to extract the universal part of the anomalous\ndimension, which is the same for any object, including black holes, neutron\nstars, and binary systems. As an application, we propose a novel resummation of\nthe universal short-distance logarithms (``tails'') in the gravitational\nwaveform of binary systems, which may improve the modeling of signals from\ncurrent and future gravitational wave experiments.",

By integrating\nprinciples from both the metric and Palatini formulations, HMPG provides a\nflexible approach to addressing persistent challenges in General Relativity\n(GR), such as the late-time cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark matter.\nUnder the assumption of spherical symmetry, we employ an inverse problem\ntechnique to derive exact solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal\nframes. This method naturally leads to configurations involving either\ncanonical or phantom scalar fields. A thorough examination of horizon\nstructures, throat conditions, asymptotic behaviour, and curvature regularity\n(via the Kretschmann scalar) reveals the intricate causal structures permitted\nby this theoretical model. The analysis uncovers a diverse range of geometric\nconfigurations, with the phantom sector exhibiting a notably richer spectrum of\nsolutions than the canonical case. These solutions encompass traversable\nwormholes, black universe models, where the interior of a black hole evolves\ninto an expanding cosmological phase rather than a singularity, as well as\nblack bounce structures and multi-horizon black holes. The results demonstrate\nthat introducing a non-zero scalar potential within HMPG significantly expands\nthe array of possible gravitational solutions, yielding complex causal and\ncurvature properties that go beyond standard GR. Consequently, HMPG stands out\nas a powerful theoretical framework for modelling extreme astrophysical\nenvironments, where deviations from classical gravity are expected to play a\ncrucial role.",

While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers an efficient\nalternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback, traditional DPO\nmethods are limited by their reliance on single preference pairs. Recent work\nlike Curriculum-DPO integrates multiple pairs using a one-dimensional\ndifficulty curriculum based on pairwise distinguishability (PD), but overlooks\nthe complexity of the input prompt itself. To address this, we propose\n2D-Curri-DPO, a novel framework employing a two-dimensional curriculum that\njointly models Prompt Complexity (PC) and Pairwise Distinguishability. This\nframework introduces dual difficulty metrics to quantify prompt semantic\ncomplexity and response preference clarity, defines a curriculum strategy space\nencompassing multiple selectable strategies for task adaptation, and\nincorporates a KL-divergence-based adaptive mechanism for dynamic reference\nmodel updates to enhance training stability.

To address these\nchallenges, this paper introduces V2V3D, an unsupervised view2view-based\nframework that establishes a new paradigm for joint optimization of image\ndenoising and 3D reconstruction in a unified architecture. We assume that the\nLF images are derived from a consistent 3D signal, with the noise in each view\nbeing independent.

To enhance the recovery of high-frequency\ndetails, we propose a novel wave-optics-based feature alignment technique,\nwhich transforms the point spread function, used for forward propagation in\nwave optics, into convolution kernels specifically designed for feature\nalignment. Moreover, we introduce an LFM dataset containing LF images and their\ncorresponding 3D intensity volumes.

A graph $F$ is called\ncolor-critical if it contains an edge whose deletion reduces its chromatic\nnumber. Extending the Tur\\'{a}n theorem, Simonovits (1968) proved that for any\ncolor-critical graph $F$ with $\\chi (F)=r+1$ and sufficiently large $n$, the\nTur\\'{a}n graph $T_{n,r}$ is the unique graph with maximum number of edges\namong all $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. Subsequently, Nikiforov [Electron. J.\nCombin., 16 (1) (2009)] proved a spectral version of the Simonovits theorem in\nterms of the adjacency spectral radius. In this paper, we show an extension of\nthe Simonovits theorem for the signless Laplacian spectral radius. We prove\nthat for any color-critical graph $F$ with $\\chi (F)=r+1\\ge 4$ and sufficiently\nlarge $n$, if $G$ is an $F$-free graph on $n$ vertices, then $q(G)\\le\nq(T_{n,r})$, with equality if and only if $G=T_{n,r}$. Our approach is to\nestablish a signless Laplacian spectral version of the criterion of Keevash,\nLenz and Mubayi [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 28 (4) (2014)]. Consequently, we can\ndetermine the signless Laplacian spectral extremal graphs for generalized books\nand even wheels. As an application, our result gives an upper bound on the\ndegree power of an $F$-free graph. We show that if $n$ is sufficiently large\nand $G$ is an $F$-free graph on $n$ vertices with $m$ edges, then $\\sum_{v\\in\nV(G)} d^2(v) \\le 2(1- \\frac{1}{r})mn$, with equality if and only if $G$ is a\nregular Tur\\'{a}n graph $T_{n,r}$.

Traditional optimization\ntechniques often struggle with computational efficiency, necessitating the\ndevelopment of novel approaches. Purpose: This study introduces QC-BAO, a\nhybrid quantum-classical approach that leverages quantum computing to solve the\nMIP formulation of BAO. Methods: The proposed approach, QC-BAO, models BAO as\nan MIP problem, incorporating binary variables for beam angle selection and\ncontinuous variables for optimizing spot intensities for proton therapy. The\nproposed approach employs a hybrid quantum-classical framework, utilizing\nquantum computing to solve the binary decision component while integrating\nclassical optimization techniques, including iterative convex relaxation and\nalternating direction method of multipliers. Results: Computational experiments\nwere conducted on clinical test cases to evaluate QC-BAO's performance against\nclinically verified angles and a heuristic approach, GS-BAO.

Existing research has highlighted both the limitations\nof LLMs in interpreting vague or poorly structured prompts and the difficulties\nusers face in crafting precise queries. This study investigates learner-AI\ninteractions through an educational experiment in which participants receive\nstructured guidance on effective prompting. We introduce and compare three\ntypes of prompting guidelines: a task-specific framework developed through a\nstructured methodology and two baseline approaches. To assess user behavior and\nprompting efficacy, we analyze a dataset of 642 interactions from 107 users.\nUsing Von NeuMidas, an extended pragmatic annotation schema for LLM interaction\nanalysis, we categorize common prompting errors and identify recurring\nbehavioral patterns. We then evaluate the impact of different guidelines by\nexamining changes in user behavior, adherence to prompting strategies, and the\noverall quality of AI-generated responses. Our findings provide a deeper\nunderstanding of how users engage with LLMs and the role of structured\nprompting guidance in enhancing AI-assisted communication.

Optimizing\nmacroscale material properties for polymeric systems is difficult as properties\nare dictated by features on a multitude of length scales, ranging from the\nchosen monomer chemistries to the chain level design to larger-scale domain\nstructures.

We utilize MD simulations with polymer\nchains preplaced into selected nanoscale morphologies and perform virtual\nexperiments to determine the stability of the chosen polymer design within the\ntarget morphology and calculate the desired macroscale material properties\n(e.g., thermal conductivity).

        "summary": "Common-sense reasoning is a key language model capability because it\nencapsulates not just specific factual knowledge but rather general language\nand world understanding. Measuring common-sense reasoning, therefore, is\ncrucial for language models of different sizes and applications. One of the\nmost widely used benchmarks for evaluating such capabilities is HellaSwag;\nhowever, in this paper, we show that it has severe construct validity issues.\nThese issues range from basic ungrammaticality and numerous typos to misleading\nprompts or equally correct options. Furthermore, we show that if models are\nevaluated only on answer texts, or with \"Lorem ipsum dolor...\" instead of the\nquestion, more than 65% of model predictions remain the same, and this cannot\nbe attributed merely to contamination. Since benchmark scores are an essential\npart of model selection in both research and commercial applications, these\nvalidity issues can have severe consequences. In particular, knowing that\ntaking benchmark scores at face value is ubiquitous, inadequate evaluation\nleads to ill-informed decisions about models. In this paper, we thoroughly\ninvestigate critical validity issues posed by HellaSwag and illustrate them\nwith various evaluations using generative language models of different sizes.\nWe argue that this benchmark does not accurately measure common-sense reasoning\nand, therefore, should not be used for evaluation in its current state. Based\non the results of our study, we propose requirements that should be met by\nfuture common-sense reasoning benchmarks. In addition, we release GoldenSwag, a\ncorrected subset of HellaSwag, which, to our belief, facilitates acceptable\ncommon-sense reasoning evaluation.",

        "summary": "Visualizations are vital for communicating scientific results. Historically,\nneuroimaging figures have only depicted regions that surpass a given\nstatistical threshold. This practice substantially biases interpretation of the\nresults and subsequent meta-analyses, particularly towards non-reproducibility.\nHere we advocate for a \"transparent thresholding\" approach that not only\nhighlights statistically significant regions but also includes subthreshold\nlocations, which provide key experimental context. This balances the dual needs\nof distilling modeling results and enabling informed interpretations for modern\nneuroimaging. We present four examples that demonstrate the many benefits of\ntransparent thresholding, including: removing ambiguity, decreasing\nhypersensitivity to non-physiological features, catching potential artifacts,\nimproving cross-study comparisons, reducing non-reproducibility biases, and\nclarifying interpretations. We also demonstrate the many software packages that\nimplement transparent thresholding, several of which were added or streamlined\nrecently as part of this work. A point-counterpoint discussion addresses issues\nwith thresholding raised in real conversations with researchers in the field.\nWe hope that by showing how transparent thresholding can drastically improve\nthe interpretation (and reproducibility) of neuroimaging findings, more\nresearchers will adopt this method.",

        "summary": "Being one of the first exoplanets observed by the James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST), WASP-39 b has become an iconic target and many transit spectra recorded\nwith different instruments (NIRISS, NIRCAM, NIRSpec G395H, NIRSpec PRISM and\nMIRI) are currently available, allowing in-depth studies of its atmosphere. We\npresent here a novel approach to interpret WASP-39 b's transit spectroscopic\ndata, consisting of a multi-step process where ab initio equilibrium chemistry\nmodels and blind retrievals are used iteratively to find physically robust,\noptimal solutions. Following this approach, we have identified a new scenario\nto explain WASP-39 b's atmospheric composition, in which silicon-based\nchemistry plays a major role. In this scenario, SiO may explain the spectral\nabsorption at 4.1 $\\mu$m, currently interpreted as being due to SO$_2$. SiO and\nthe other gas species identified by the retrieval models, i.e. H$_2$O, CO$_2$,\nNa and K, are consistent with an atmosphere in chemical equilibrium with a\ntemperature-pressure profile constrained by H$_2$O and CO$_2$ absorption bands.\nIn addition, silicate clouds and hazes can produce the spectral features\nobserved by MIRI in the spectral window 5-12 $\\mu$m. While we advocate the need\nfor more data, possibly at higher spectral resolution, to confirm our results\nfor WASP-39 b's atmospheric composition, we highlight a refined atmospheric\nretrieval strategy with pre-selection and post-reconstruction to guide the next\ngeneration of transit spectroscopy.",

        "summary": "Spatio-temporal traffic prediction is crucial in intelligent transportation\nsystems. The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex\nspatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data.\nTraditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static\nadjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be\noverfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when\nconsidering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance\nprediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant\nhurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study\nintroduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task\nLearning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation\nmodule that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific\ngating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the\nmodelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show\nthat our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its\neffectiveness and robustness.",

We find\nthat as b increases, the system transitions smoothly from the RN regime towards\nthe Schwarzschild profile, with observable changes in the innermost stable\ncircular orbit (ISCO) and Keplerian frequencies. We further investigate the\nvariation in the radii of QPOs with respect to the NED parameter b by employing\nthe RP, WD, and ER models. We also perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nanalysis using observational QPO data from a diverse set of black hole sources\nspanning stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive regimes. The MCMC\nresults yield consistent constraints on the parameter b across all mass\nregimes, indicating that NED effects leave a distinguishable signature on the\nQPO structure of a charged black hole.",

We adapt a solution by\nintroducing an extra scalar field that significantly enhances $CP$ asymmetry\nthrough loop-level contributions. This scalar extension not only facilitates\nsuccessful leptogenesis but also enables a strong first-order electroweak phase\ntransition, generating potentially observable gravitational waves (GWs). We\ndemonstrate a strong correlation between the generated BAU and the GW signal\nstrength, establishing a unique way to test the leptogenesis. We show that when\nthe model achieves a successful BAU, the resulting GW signal from EWPT can have\nsignal-to-noise ratio of $\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ at the\nupcoming LISA and DECIGO experiments, respectively. This work presents a\nconcrete connection between successful leptogenesis and detectable GWs,\noffering a promising method for experimental testing of the leptogenesis\nmechanism through future GW observations.",
